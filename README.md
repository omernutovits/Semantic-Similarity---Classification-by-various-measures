# Semantic-Similarity---Classification-by-various-measures
Based on a research paper, we modified its algorithm, re-designed for map-reduce, and evaluated the results.

Research Paper - https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dsp211/wiki.files/04588492.pdf

What we have done -
Read the paper of Ljubešić et al.: Comparing Measures of Semantic Similarity.
Understood the various measures of association with context and vector similarity.
Understood algorithm modifications made specifically for this assignment.
Examined the various aspects of the system, and identify components that may utilize the map-reduce pattern.
Designed a parallel algorithm, based on the Map-Reduce pattern.
Implemented the system.
Ran experiments on 10% of the corpus and on 100% of the corpus.
Analyzed and reported our results using Weka.
